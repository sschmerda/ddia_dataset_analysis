# DDIA - Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of datasets belonging to the educational domain. For each dataset it includes:  
- Dataset construction and cleaning
- EDA
- Sequence distance calculation and analysis
- Sequence clustering and subsequent comparison of different evaluation metric distributions between clusters
  
## Final results
TODO: Add notebook and pdf with the most important results of the analysis 

## File-Structure
TODO: Create directory tree

## Links to Raw Data
The analysis is based on the following datasets:

- [Link to Cleaned Datasets on Zenodo]() -> not available yet due to zenodo only allowing a single upload without further edits later on

Each dataset folder contains:
1. The cleaned and transformed dataset
2. A file used to map new field names to the ones found in the raw data
3. A file used to map new field values to the ones found in the raw data
